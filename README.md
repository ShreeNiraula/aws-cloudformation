AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables users to automate the process of deploying and managing their infrastructure as code. It allows users to define a collection of AWS resources and their configurations in a YAML or JSON template file, and then deploys and provisions those resources in a consistent and repeatable manner. AWS CloudFormation supports a wide range of AWS services and integrates with other AWS tools such as AWS CloudTrail, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and AWS CloudWatch. It is useful for creating and managing complex and highly scalable AWS infrastructure as well as for maintaining consistency and reducing deployment time.
